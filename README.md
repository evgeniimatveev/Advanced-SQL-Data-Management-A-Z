### **ADVANCED SQL SCRIPTS (ORIGINAL):**
This folder contains additional advanced SQL scripts that demonstrate complex concepts and techniques. These scripts are organized by theme and can be useful for deepening your understanding of SQL:
- **Aggregate Functions**: Demonstrates the use of SQL functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, etc., for aggregating data.
- **COMMON TABLE EXPRESSION (CTE)**: Shows examples of how to use CTEs to write more readable and maintainable SQL queries.
- **Re-answering Business Questions**: Practical examples of how to use SQL for answering common business queries.
- **ReDDL_DML_TCL_DQL_DCL.sql**: Covers Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Transaction Control Language (TCL), and Data Query Language (DQL) practices.
- **Understanding_JOINS.sql**: Explains the different types of SQL JOINs with examples.
- **Window_CTE_Views_StoredProc.sql**: A comprehensive script combining window functions, CTEs, views, and stored procedures.
